# Lock Feature (Coming Soon)

This innovative feature is currently under development and will be available in future updates. Here's what to expect:

- **Simple Lock**: By default, locking will allow elements to be fixed in place.
- **Multi-Lock**: The same button can be used to lock multiple elements together.
- **Grouping**: When elements are multi-locked, a new button will appear, listing everything locked together with tick marks for easy locking or unlocking.
- **Manage Old Locks**: Previously locked elements remain in the list unchecked. However, a delete button will be introduced to remove these inactive items from the grouping.

Stay tuned for updates!
